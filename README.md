## What kind of game mechanics does it provide?
- Allowing crops to automaticly planted without right clicking.
- Planting only works on **farmland** & **soul_sand**.

### How does it work?
Example, if a player is holding any type of **seed** or **crop** in their main hand.
lets say, "**minecraft:carrot**" or "**minecraft:wheat_seeds**" the game will automaticly take it from their inventory and automatic place it and remove it out there inventory.
